// TestGodog is the single entry point for the godog BDD suite. It runs every
// .feature file under tests/bdd/features.
//
// Strict mode is MANDATORY and MUST NOT be disabled. When Strict is true,
// godog fails the suite on any undefined or pending step — silently
// skipping unimplemented fixtures is the single most common BDD failure
// mode and we refuse to let it past CI. The CI workflow carries a guard
// job that greps every BDD entry file for the Strict flag and fails the
// build if the flag is missing or set to false. See
// .github/workflows/ci.yml → bdd-strict-mode-guard.
