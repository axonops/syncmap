# check-bench-regression.sh — parse a benchstat report and fail on regressions.
#
# Invoked by `make bench-regression` and by the benchstat-regression-guard CI
# job. The input is benchstat's default human-readable report comparing
# `bench.txt` (committed baseline) to `current.txt` (this run).
#
# Fail criteria (issue #15 AC):
#   - Any `time/op` regression >= 10% at p <= 0.05
#   - Any `allocs/op` regression > 0% (allocation increases are blocking
#     regardless of statistical significance).
#
# Bytes-per-op is treated the same as time/op (10% + p<=0.05) since a bytes
# increase without a commensurate allocs increase usually indicates a
# structural change worth reviewing.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  no regressions above threshold
#   1  one or more regressions found
#   2  usage error (missing arg or file)

# benchstat (golang.org/x/perf/cmd/benchstat v0.0.0-20240730-ish) emits
# three tables, each introduced by a TWO-line header that looks like:
#
#     │ old.txt │  new.txt            │
#     │  sec/op │  sec/op    vs base  │
#
# The metric name lives on the second header line between box-drawing
# pipes. We detect it and set the current section. Any subsequent line
# with a "+X.XX%" delta is a regression candidate for that metric.
#
# Sections identified:
#   sec/op     — time per op (threshold: >= 10% at p <= 0.05)
#   B/op       — bytes per op (same threshold as time)
#   allocs/op  — allocation count per op (ANY increase fails)
