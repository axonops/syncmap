# generate-contributors.sh — turn signatures/version1/cla.json into a
# human-readable CONTRIBUTORS.md.
#
# The CLA Assistant workflow writes every signed CLA into the JSON
# file as an append-only list. This script regenerates the public
# list from that file, sorted deterministically so re-runs produce
# byte-identical output.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/generate-contributors.sh [signatures-path] [output-path]
#
# Defaults:
#   signatures-path = signatures/version1/cla.json
#   output-path     = CONTRIBUTORS.md
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  success (wrote output-path)
#   2  signatures file missing or unreadable
#   3  jq not installed
#
# Called by .github/workflows/contributors.yml on pushes to main that
# touch the signatures file.
