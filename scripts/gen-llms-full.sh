This file is the concatenated corpus of every human-facing source of
truth for `github.com/axonops/syncmap`: the `llms.txt` summary, the
README, the package godoc, the security policy, the changelog, and
the full generated godoc reference. It exists so AI assistants (and
humans ingesting offline) can read the entire library's
documentation in a single file without crawling the repo.

Regenerate with `make llms-full`. CI fails the build if the
committed file is out of date relative to its sources.
